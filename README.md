# Dissertation Project

This repository contains the implementation and experimental setup for my dissertation project, focused on deploying and managing microservices using Kubernetes.

The project demonstrates:

- A lightweight Kubernetes cluster using **k3s** on Ubuntu (WSL2).

> Note: The cluster is intended for development and experimentation. Production-grade performance, high availability, and advanced networking features are outside the scope of this setup.
